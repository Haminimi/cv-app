## Reflection
I am very excited to work with [React](https://react.dev/). I find it powerful, extremely useful, and interesting to work with.

Currently, the project just takes user input and displays it. There is a lot of space for improvement, aiming to transform this project into a fully developed CV builder/generator site. However, the main goal of the project is achieved.
